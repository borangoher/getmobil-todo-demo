# To-do Demo

This is a demo app featuring a to-do planner.

## Project Description

This to-do application supports a small number of features to plan tasks.
Users can add tasks, mark added tasks as completed, and delete tasks entirely.
The app also allows users to filter tasks by their completion status and view some
statistics regarding the number of tasks. Task data is stored in localStorage and
should persist between page refreshes unless the browser data is deleted by the user.

## How to Run

Run `npm install` in the project root to install dependencies. Run `npm run dev`
in order to start a development server at `localhost:3000`. The dev server should
be enough to test the demo.
